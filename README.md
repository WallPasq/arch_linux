<cite>Note: For now I no longer use Arch Linux and therefore this repository will no longer be updated.</cite>

<p>Welcome to my Arch Linux settings!
In this repository I'll place the configuration files (when I have changed the same) of my installed packages.</p>

<p>Shell: ZSH.<br />
Text editor: Emacs.<br />
Window Manager (WM): exwm.</p>
